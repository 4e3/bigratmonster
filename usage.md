## Why does this page exist

`bigrat.monster` is created just for a joke. The domain is going to expire on 2021-07-11 unless someone pays me to continue the website.

## Some things you need to know

The `fonts/` folder is not included in the repository due to me being scared of copyright takedowns.

You can get the fonts by going to the [Source速 Sans Pro] or the [Source速 Code Pro] \(Use the non-variable versions) GitHub repository and download the fonts form the Releases page.  
Rename the unzipped folder to `source-sans-pro` and `source-code-pro` respectively, create a folder on the root directory of the cloned repository called `fonts` and place them into the folder.
