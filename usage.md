## Why does this page exist

bigrat.monster is created just for a joke. The domain is going to expire on 2021-07-11 unless someone pays me to continue the website.

## Some thing you need to know

The `/fonts` folder is not included in the repository due to [me][ricoip] being scared of copyright takedowns.

You can get the fonts by going to the [Source速 Sans Pro] or the [Source速 Code Pro] \(Use the non-variable versions) GitHub repository and download the fonts form the Releases page.  
Rename the unzipped folder to `source-sans-pro` and `source-code-pro` respectively and place them into the `/fonts` folder.
